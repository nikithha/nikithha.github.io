# 9TH MAY 2023
 First day, the students were research and learn what an AAC device and to come up with a low-tech AAC device.

* learn about what an AAC device is.
    + A single button AAC sound button in which you could record the sound byte you wanted. 
    + We can find the different level of aac device like high tech,low tech,mid tech.But the main focus with the mid tech AAC device
* create a presentation on the prototype


# 10th may 2023
On the second day, all are presented their individual ideas to the CEO of Evocube Technologies and the faculty incharge of fablab

* presented the idea to the CEO of Evocube Technologies, Tom sir of Fablab and my fellow students.
* valuable feedback was generated
* after the presentation, we were tasked with making a basic design of the device in autodesk.
* downloaded Autodesk Fusion 360 and found resources to learn it from.


# 11th may 2023
We were only focused on learning the fundemental tools in fusion 360 on this day.

* started to learn about Autodesk Fusion 360.
* just started with the 3d print of fablab logo with the help of a youtube


# 12th may 2023
Today was the deadline to make the submit the design to the faculty incharge.
* design was not completed but just design an basic structure of my design.

# 15th may 2023
The faculty had organised a class headed by the ceo of evocube technologies 

* was taught the basics of a good design 
* shown some of the devices the company had designed and the constraints and difficulties they had.


# 19th may 2023
A meeting was scheduled to teach us about the basics of the electronics side of the device.It was with our Alumini

* we were provided with links and relevant resourses to prototype our device using arduinos 
* we were given valuable tips on how to go about doing that.
* [this is the main resource](https://www.instructables.com/Audio-Player-Using-Arduino-With-Micro-SD-Card/).
